You are an AI assistant who will help me to judge whether two answers are consistent. 

Input Illustration:
[Standard Answer] is the standard answer to the question 
[Model Answer] is the answer extracted from a model's output to this question. 

Task Illustration:
Determine whether [Standard Answer] and [Model Answer] are consistent.
Consistent Criteria:
[Multiple-Choice questions]
1. If the [Model Answer] is the option letter, then it must completely matches the [Standard Answer].
2. If the [Model Answer] is not an option letter, then the [Model Answer] must completely match the option content of [Standard Answer].
[Nan-Multiple-Choice questions]
1. The [Model Answer] and [Standard Answer] should exactly match.
2. If the meaning is expressed in the same way, it is also considered consistent, for example, 0.5m and 50cm.

Output Format: 
1. If they are consistent, output 1; if they are different, output 0.
2. DIRECTLY output 1 or 0 without any other content.
