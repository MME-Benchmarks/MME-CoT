## 👀 About MME-CoT

Answering questions with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) still lacks a systematic assessment and in-depth investigation.

In this paper, we introduce **MME-CoT**, a specialized benchmark evaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, **spanning six domains**: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive study in this area, we propose a **thorough evaluation suite** incorporating **three novel metrics** that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at a fine-grained level.

</p>

Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique evaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs, uncovering **several key insights**: **(1) Models with reflection mechanism demonstrate a superior CoT quality**, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and demonstrating the highest quality results; **(2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM performance on perception-heavy tasks**, suggesting a potentially harmful overthinking behavior; **(3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with reflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and self-correction phases**. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning in LMMs.

## Inference

### Inference with lmms-eval
We support running inference on MME-CoT with [lmms-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval). And then run the evaluation of each metric detailed in the [Eval](https://github.com/CaraJ7/MME-CoT#evaluation) section.

Please first install lmms-eval as demonstrated in its official GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval#installation).

Then, run the inference with the CoT prompt (needed for: Precision, Recall, Stability, Efficacy, Reflection Quality, and Relevance Rate):
```
accelerate launch --num_processes=8 --main_process_port=12345 -m lmms_eval \
    --model TESTED_MODEL \
    --model_args=pretrained=TESTED_MODEL_NAME \
    --tasks mme_cot_reason \
    --batch_size 1 --log_samples --log_samples_suffix output_cot --output_path ./logs/
```
Run the inference with the Direct prompt (needed for: Stability and Efficacy):
```
accelerate launch --num_processes=8 --main_process_port=12345 -m lmms_eval \
    --model TESTED_MODEL \
    --model_args=pretrained=TESTED_MODEL_NAME \
    --tasks mme_cot_direct \
    --batch_size 1 --log_samples --log_samples_suffix output_dir --output_path ./logs/
```

Then, format the output json file to the evaluation output as illustrated [here](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval/tree/main/lmms_eval/tasks/mme_cot):
```
cd tasks/mme_cot
# For CoT prompt
python tools/update_lmmseval_json.py \
--lmms_eval_json_path mmecot_reasoning_test_for_submission.json \
--save_path results/json/YOUR_MODEL_NAME_cot.json

# For direct prompt
python tools/update_lmmseval_json.py \
--lmms_eval_json_path mmecot_direct_test_for_submission.json \
--save_path results/json/YOUR_MODEL_NAME_dir.json
```

Finally, run the evaluation illustrated below.

### Inference with VLMEvalKit
We also support running inference on MME-CoT with [VLMEvalkit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit). And then run the evaluation of each metric detailed in the [Eval](https://github.com/CaraJ7/MME-CoT#evaluation) section.

Please first install VLMEvalKit as demonstrated in its official GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit/blob/main/docs/en/Quickstart.md).

Then, run the inference with the CoT prompt (needed for: Precision, Recall, Stability, Efficacy, Reflection Quality, and Relevance Rate):
```
USE_COT_PROMPT=1 \
python run.py \
--data MME_CoT_TEST \
--model TESTED_MODEL \
--verbose \
--work-dir cot_results
```
Run the inference with the Direct prompt (needed for: Stability and Efficacy):
```
USE_COT_PROMPT=0 \
python run.py \
--data MME_CoT_TEST \
--model TESTED_MODEL \
--verbose \
--work-dir direct_results
```
Rename the result file `MODELNAME_MME_CoT_TEST.xlsx` to either `MODELNAME_MME_CoT_TEST_cot.xlsx` or `MODELNAME_MME_CoT_TEST_dir.xlsx`, depending on the prompt used. 

Finally, run the evaluation illustrated below.


## Evaluation

To calculate the six metrics (precision, recall, efficacy, stability, relevance rate, reflection quality), please follow the following steps:
1. Install the required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Format the model answer.

     + If you evaluate with lmms-eval, please follow the [instruction above](https://github.com/CaraJ7/MME-CoT#Inference-with-lmms-eval) to convert to valid json format.
     + If you evaluate with VLMEvalKit, you can directly use the output xlsx.
     + We also provide examples shown in `results/xlsx` (the output from VLMEvalKit) and `results/json`. The json file should be in a jsonl format, with each answer to a question in one line. All the other information of the question in the dataset should be preserved in the line.

     The suffix `_cot.json` denotes answering with the CoT prompt, and `_dir.json` denotes answering with the direct prompt.
4. Run the evaluation script.

     You can either run the metrics one by one. For example, to evaluate recall:
     ```
     bash scripts/recall.sh
     ```
     Simply change the `YOUR_MODEL_NAME` and the data path in the `recall.sh` file.

     Or you can run all the metrics for all the models in one directory with:

     ```
     bash batch_scripts/run_all.py --result_dir results/xlsx
     ```

     After GPT evaluation, you are expected to obtain a `cache/` directory like this:
    ```
      📂 cache
       ┣━━ 📂 recall
       ┃    ┗━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME
       ┃         ┣━━ 📄 1.json
       ┃         ┣━━ 📄 2.json
       ┃         ┗━━ 📄 ...
       ┣━━ 📂 precision
       ┃    ┗━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME
       ┣━━ 📂 relevance_rate
       ┃    ┗━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME
       ┣━━ 📂 reflection_quality
       ┃    ┗━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME
       ┣━━ 📂 extract
       ┃    ┣━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME_dir
       ┃    ┗━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME_cot
       ┗━━ 📂 judge
            ┣━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME_dir
            ┗━━ 📂 YOUR_MODEL_NAME_cot
    ```
    Note that, if your model does not contain reflection process, you do not need to run `reflection_quality.sh`. The metric calculation script below will handle that automatically.
5. Calculate the metrics.

     We cache the evaluation results of all the questions in the cache dir. Here we read the results from the cache dir and calculate the metrics. 

     For example, to calculate quality:
     
     ```bash
     python final_score/quality.py --cache_dir cache --save_path final_results
     ```
     
     The script will automatically calculate recall and precision, then calculate the f1 score or average score.
     
     Or, you can calculate each metric one by one. For example, to calculate recall:
     
     ```bash
     python final_score/recall.py --cache_dir cache/recall --save_path final_results
     ```
     
     
### Notes

1. The structure of the `scripts` directory:
   ```
    📂 scripts
     ┣━━ 📜 recall.sh           # evaluate recall
     ┣━━ 📜 precision.sh        # evaluate precision
     ┣━━ 📜 reflection_quality.sh  # evaluate reflection quality
     ┣━━ 📜 relevance_rate.sh   # evaluate relevance rate
     ┣━━ 📜 extract.sh          # First step of direct evaluation (for robustness): Extract final answers from model responses
     ┗━━ 📜 judge.sh            # Second step of direct evaluation (for robustness): Judge the correctness of the extracted answers
   ```
